//! Core traits and data structures used by Titan-compatible trading venues.
//!
//! A "trading venue" is any automated market maker (AMM), orderbook, or
//! proprietary liquidity engine that wishes to integrate with Titan’s quoting
//! and routing framework.
//!
//! Implementers are responsible for correctly handling state updates,
//! account deserialization, quoting semantics, and swap instruction
//! generation. Titan aggregates venues based on these traits after some
//! proprietary modifications to the logic provided by integrating partners.
